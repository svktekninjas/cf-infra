# CF-DB Role Documentation Index

## Quick Navigation

### Getting Started
- **[README.md](README.md)** - Main overview and quick start guide
- **[01-role-setup.md](01-role-setup.md)** - Create basic role structure and directories
- **[02-defaults-configuration.md](02-defaults-configuration.md)** - Configure default variables and settings
- **[03-environment-configuration.md](03-environment-configuration.md)** - Create environment-specific configurations

### Task Implementation
- **[04-private-subnets-task.md](04-private-subnets-task.md)** - Create multi-AZ private subnets
- **[05-nat-gateway-task.md](05-nat-gateway-task.md)** - Setup NAT Gateway and routing

### Additional Documentation Needed
The following guides are referenced in the main README but would need to be created:
- `06-security-groups-task.md` - Configure cross-VPC security groups
- `07-aurora-cluster-task.md` - Deploy Aurora PostgreSQL cluster
- `08-main-orchestration.md` - Create main task orchestration
- `09-testing-validation.md` - Test individual tasks and full role

## Documentation Status

### Completed âœ…
1. **Role Setup** (01) - Complete directory structure and initial files
2. **Defaults Configuration** (02) - Comprehensive default variables
3. **Environment Configuration** (03) - Dev/test/prod environment configs
4. **Private Subnets Task** (04) - Multi-AZ subnet creation with validation
5. **NAT Gateway Task** (05) - Internet access and routing configuration

### Available Implementation (From Working Role)
The following tasks have been successfully implemented and tested:
- Security Groups Task (Cross-VPC access configuration)
- Aurora Cluster Task (PostgreSQL cluster with writer/reader instances)
- Main Orchestration (Task coordination and dependency management)
- Testing and Validation (Individual and full role execution)

## How to Use This Documentation

### For Complete Beginners
1. Start with **[README.md](README.md)** for overview
2. Follow the numbered guides in sequence (01-05)
3. Each guide builds on the previous one
4. Test each component as you build it

### For Experienced Users
- Jump to specific task documentation as needed
- Use the working implementation in the parent directories as reference
- Adapt configurations for your specific AWS environment

### For Troubleshooting
- Each guide includes troubleshooting sections
- Check AWS console to verify resource creation
- Use the debug commands provided in each guide

## Key Features Covered

### Infrastructure Components
- **Multi-AZ Private Subnets** - Database isolation across availability zones
- **NAT Gateway & Routing** - Internet access for private resources
- **Cross-VPC Security Groups** - ROSA cluster database connectivity
- **Aurora PostgreSQL Cluster** - High-availability database with reader replica

### Ansible Best Practices
- **Modular Design** - Individual task files with clear responsibilities
- **Dependency Management** - Automatic resolution of task dependencies
- **Environment Separation** - Dev/test/prod configuration inheritance
- **Comprehensive Tagging** - Resource organization and cost tracking
- **Error Handling** - Validation and meaningful error messages

### AWS Best Practices
- **Security First** - Private subnets, no public database access
- **High Availability** - Multi-AZ deployment patterns
- **Cost Optimization** - Environment-appropriate instance sizing
- **Resource Management** - Consistent naming and tagging strategies

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Create complete role from scratch (following this documentation)
# Start with:
mkdir -p roles/cf-db
cd roles/cf-db

# Test individual components (after implementation)
ansible-playbook playbooks/main.yml -t private-subnets
ansible-playbook playbooks/main.yml -t nat-gateway
ansible-playbook playbooks/main.yml -t security-groups
ansible-playbook playbooks/main.yml -t db-cluster

# Deploy complete infrastructure
ansible-playbook playbooks/main.yml -t cf-db
```

## Learning Path

### Beginner (4-6 hours)
1. Complete guides 01-05 following step-by-step instructions
2. Test each component individually
3. Understand the AWS resources being created
4. Practice with dev environment first

### Intermediate (2-3 hours)
1. Adapt configurations for your environment
2. Implement the remaining tasks using working examples
3. Add custom validation and error handling
4. Deploy to test environment

### Advanced (1-2 hours)
1. Enhance with additional features (monitoring, backup automation)
2. Implement production-grade configurations
3. Add automated testing and CI/CD integration
4. Deploy to production environment
