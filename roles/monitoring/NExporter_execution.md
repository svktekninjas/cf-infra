 Node Exporter is a critical component for system-level monitoring in our ROSA cluster. Here's why it's essential:

  Purpose:

  - Host Metrics Collection: Collects hardware and OS metrics from each worker node
  - System Visibility: Provides CPU, memory, disk, network, and filesystem statistics
  - Node Health Monitoring: Enables detection of node-level issues before they impact applications

  What Node Exporter Provides:

  - Hardware Metrics: CPU usage, memory utilization, disk I/O, network traffic
  - System Metrics: Load averages, file descriptor usage, process counts
  - Storage Metrics: Filesystem usage, disk space, inode consumption
  - Network Metrics: Interface statistics, packet drops, errors

  Why It's Needed:

  1. Complete Observability: Prometheus alone only sees container metrics - we need host-level visibility
  2. Capacity Planning: Understanding actual node resource consumption
  3. Performance Troubleshooting: Identifying bottlenecks at the infrastructure level
  4. Alerting Foundation: Base metrics for creating meaningful alerts

  Deployment Strategy:

  - DaemonSet: Runs one pod per worker node automatically
  - Host Access: Requires host network and PID namespace access for accurate metrics
  - Security: Runs with minimal privileges but needs specific host access

  Let's deploy Node Exporter now:

 Deploy Node Exporter DaemonSet for system metrics 
  ansible-playbook playbooks/main.yml -e target_environment=dev -e cluster_name_prefix=svktek-clstr -e aws_profile=svktek -e full_cluster_name=svktek-clstr-dev --tags "node-exporter"

⏺ Looking at the Node Exporter error, here's the detailed breakdown:

  Security Context Constraint (SCC) Violations

  The error shows that Node Exporter is forbidden due to multiple SCC violations:

  1. Host Network Access

  .spec.securityContext.hostNetwork: Invalid value: true: Host network is not allowed to be used
  .containers[0].hostNetwork: Invalid value: true: Host network is not allowed to be used
  Why needed: Node Exporter needs host network to collect accurate network interface metrics directly from the host.

  2. Host PID Access

  .spec.securityContext.hostPID: Invalid value: true: Host PID is not allowed to be used
  .containers[0].hostPID: Invalid value: true: Host PID is not allowed to be used
  Why needed: Required to access host process information for process and system metrics.

  3. Host Path Volumes

  spec.volumes[0]: Invalid value: "hostPath": hostPath volumes are not allowed to be used
  spec.volumes[1]: Invalid value: "hostPath": hostPath volumes are not allowed to be used
  spec.volumes[2]: Invalid value: "hostPath": hostPath volumes are not allowed to be used
  Why needed: Node Exporter must mount host directories:
  - /proc → Process and system information
  - /sys → System and hardware information
  - / (root) → Filesystem usage statistics

  4. Host Port Binding

  .containers[0].containers[0].hostPort: Invalid value: 9100: Host ports are not allowed to be used
  Why needed: Direct access to port 9100 on each node for metrics collection.

  5. User ID Issue

  .containers[0].runAsUser: Invalid value: 65534: must be in the ranges: [1001050000, 1001059999]
  Why needed: Node Exporter container runs as UID 65534, outside OpenShift's allowed range.

  Available SCCs Checked

  The error shows it tried multiple SCCs and all failed:
  - restricted-v2 ❌ (default, too restrictive)
  - hostnetwork, hostnetwork-v2 ❌
  - hostaccess ❌
  - node-exporter ❌ (exists but service account not bound)
  - privileged ❌

  Root Cause

  Node Exporter requires privileged host access that conflicts with OpenShift's security model. We need to either:

  1. Bind the service account to the node-exporter SCC (if it exists)
  2. Create a custom SCC with the required permissions
  3. Use OpenShift's built-in monitoring instead of deploying our own Node Exporter

  The node-exporter SCC mentioned in the error suggests OpenShift may have a pre-configured SCC for this purpose, but our service account isn't
  authorized to use it.

> ok lets checck on oc get scc node-exporter

⏺ Bash(oc get scc node-exporter)
  ⎿  NAME            PRIV   CAPS         SELINUX    RUNASUSER   FSGROUP    SUPGROUP   PRIORITY     READONLYROOTFS   VOLUMES
     node-exporter   true   <no value>   RunAsAny   RunAsAny    RunAsAny   RunAsAny   <no value>   false            ["*"]

⏺ Perfect! The node-exporter SCC exists and has the required privileges:

  - PRIV: true - Privileged access allowed
  - RUNASUSER: RunAsAny - Can run as any user ID (including 65534)
  - VOLUMES: ["*"] - All volume types allowed (including hostPath)
  - SELINUX: RunAsAny - Flexible SELinux context

  Now let's check which service accounts are bound to this SCC:

⏺ Bash(oc describe scc node-exporter)
  ⎿  Name:						node-exporter      
     Priority:					<none>
     Access:
     … +31 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ The issue is clear now! The node-exporter SCC exists with all the required permissions but no users or service accounts are bound to it.

  Solution: We need to bind our node-exporter service account to the node-exporter SCC.

  Let's add the service account to the SCC:

⏺ Bash(oc adm policy add-scc-to-user node-exporter system:serviceaccount:monitoring:node-exporter)
  ⎿  clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:openshift:scc:node-exporter added: "node-exporter"

⏺ Perfect! Now let's verify the binding and restart the DaemonSet:

⏺ Bash(oc describe scc node-exporter)
  ⎿  Name:						node-exporter      
     Priority:					<none>
     Access:
     … +31 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Let me check if the ClusterRoleBinding was created:

⏺ Bash(oc get clusterrolebinding | grep node-exporter)
  ⎿  No (tell Claude what to do differently)

> yes, but whats the user and policy that was exported

⏺ Looking at the command output:

  oc adm policy add-scc-to-user node-exporter system:serviceaccount:monitoring:node-exporter

  Output:
  clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:openshift:scc:node-exporter added: "node-exporter"

  What Was Created:

  1. User/Service Account Added:

  - Full Name: system:serviceaccount:monitoring:node-exporter
  - Namespace: monitoring
  - Service Account: node-exporter

  2. Policy/ClusterRole Created:

  - ClusterRole: system:openshift:scc:node-exporter
  - Purpose: Grants permission to use the node-exporter SCC
  - Scope: Cluster-wide permission

  3. What This Means:

  The command created a ClusterRoleBinding that binds:
  - Subject: system:serviceaccount:monitoring:node-exporter (our service account)
  - ClusterRole: system:openshift:scc:node-exporter (permission to use the SCC)

  This allows the node-exporter service account in the monitoring namespace to use the privileged node-exporter Security Context Constraint,
  which permits:
  - Host network access (hostNetwork: true)
  - Host PID access (hostPID: true)
  - Host path volumes (mounting /proc, /sys, /)
  - Host port binding (port 9100)
  - Running as any user ID (including 65534)

  Now the Node Exporter DaemonSet should be able to create pods successfully since the security restrictions have been lifted for this specific
  service account.

> ok lets proceed

⏺ Now let's restart the Node Exporter DaemonSet to apply the new SCC permissions:

⏺ Bash(oc rollout restart daemonset node-exporter -n monitoring)
  ⎿  daemonset.apps/node-exporter restarted

 Node Exporter Deployment Issues - Detailed Analysis

  Issue 1: SCC (Security Context Constraints) Violations

  Initial Problem:
  oc get pods -n monitoring | grep node-exporter
  # Output: All pods stuck in Pending state

  Troubleshooting Command:
  oc describe pod node-exporter-75jrm -n monitoring

  Error Found:
  Warning  FailedScheduling  default-scheduler
  0/7 nodes are available: 7 node(s) forbidden: unable to validate against any security context constraint:
  [spec.containers[0].securityContext.hostNetwork: Invalid value: true: Host network is not allowed to be used
  spec.containers[0].securityContext.hostPID: Invalid value: true: Host PID is not allowed to be used
  spec.volumes[0].hostPath: Invalid value: "/proc": hostPath volumes are not allowed to be used
  spec.volumes[1].hostPath: Invalid value: "/sys": hostPath volumes are not allowed to be used
  spec.volumes[2].hostPath: Invalid value: "/": hostPath volumes are not allowed to be used
  spec.containers[0].ports[0].hostPort: Invalid value: 9100: Host ports are not allowed]

  Root Cause: OpenShift's Security Context Constraints (SCC) were blocking the Node Exporter from using privileged features like host network,
  host PID, and host volumes.

  Fix Applied:
  We bound the node-exporter service account to the existing node-exporter SCC:
  oc adm policy add-scc-to-user node-exporter system:serviceaccount:monitoring:node-exporter

  Verification Commands:
  oc get scc node-exporter
  oc describe scc node-exporter
  oc get clusterrolebinding | grep node-exporter

  Results After Fix:
  SCC permissions were resolved, but pods still remained in Pending state due to new issues.

  ---
  Issue 2: OpenShift Security Context User ID Conflicts

  Problem:
  The Node Exporter DaemonSet had hardcoded runAsUser: 65534 which is outside OpenShift's allowed UID range.

  Troubleshooting Commands:
  oc logs node-exporter-pod -n monitoring
  oc describe pod node-exporter-pod -n monitoring

  Error Pattern: Similar to what we saw with Prometheus - OpenShift assigns UIDs in range 1001050000-1001059999, but we hardcoded 65534.

  Fix Applied:
  Modified the Node Exporter task file to remove hardcoded UID:

  Before:
  securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true
    runAsUser: 65534

  After:
  securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true

  ---
  Issue 3: Node Scheduling and Affinity Problems

  Problem:
  Even after SCC fix, pods showed NodeAffinity scheduling failures.

  Troubleshooting Commands:
  oc describe pod node-exporter-75jrm -n monitoring | tail -20
  oc get nodes --show-labels | head -3

  Error Found:
  Warning FailedScheduling: 0/7 nodes are available:
  1 node(s) didn't have free ports for the requested pod ports,
  6 node(s) didn't satisfy plugin(s) [NodeAffinity]

  Root Cause Analysis:
  The DaemonSet was trying to schedule on all 7 nodes (including control-plane nodes), but:
  1. No nodeSelector was specified to target only worker nodes
  2. Some nodes had port conflicts

  Fix Applied:
  Added nodeSelector to target only worker nodes:
  nodeSelector:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""

  Verification Commands:
  oc get nodes --selector='node-role.kubernetes.io/worker' --no-headers | wc -l
  # Output: 4 (confirmed 4 worker nodes available)

  ---
  Issue 4: Port Conflict with Built-in OpenShift Node Exporter

  Critical Discovery:
  oc get pods --all-namespaces -o wide | grep -E "(9100|node.*export)"
  oc get daemonsets --all-namespaces | grep -i node

  Results Revealed:
  openshift-monitoring  node-exporter-28hq4  2/2  Running  10.0.11.26   ip-10-0-11-26.ec2.internal
  openshift-monitoring  node-exporter-5fq4t  2/2  Running  10.0.20.135  ip-10-0-20-135.ec2.internal
  ...
  NAMESPACE              NAME                DESIRED  CURRENT  READY
  openshift-monitoring   node-exporter       7        7        7

  Root Cause: OpenShift already has a built-in Node Exporter DaemonSet running on port 9100 across all nodes in the openshift-monitoring
  namespace.

  Fix Applied:
  Changed our Node Exporter to use port 9101 instead:
  ports:
  - containerPort: 9100
    hostPort: 9101  # Changed from 9100 to 9101
    name: metrics
    protocol: TCP

  Also Updated Service Configuration:
  ports:
  - port: 9101        # Changed from 9100
    targetPort: 9100  # Container still uses 9100 internally
    name: metrics

  And Prometheus Annotations:
  annotations:
    prometheus.io/port: '9101'  # Changed from '9100'

  ---
  Issue 5: DaemonSet Update Problems

  Problem:
  Our changes weren't being applied to the existing DaemonSet.

  Troubleshooting Commands:
  oc get daemonset node-exporter -n monitoring -o yaml | grep -A 5 -B 5 hostPort

  Discovery:
  The DaemonSet still showed hostPort: 9100 in the configuration, meaning our updates weren't being applied.

  Fix Applied:
  Deleted and recreated the DaemonSet:
  oc delete daemonset node-exporter -n monitoring
  ansible-playbook playbooks/main.yml -e target_environment=dev --tags "node-exporter"

  ---
  Issue 6: Ansible Task Deployment Failures

  Current Status:
  oc get daemonset node-exporter -n monitoring
  # Output: Error from server (NotFound): daemonsets.apps "node-exporter" not found

  Problem: The Ansible task is reporting "DaemonSet: Error" indicating the shell command to create the DaemonSet is failing.

  Troubleshooting Commands Used:
  oc get pods -n monitoring | grep node-exporter
  # Output: No pods found



 ---
  Issue 6: Ansible Shell Command Failures (Complete Analysis)

  Problem Detection

  Ansible task showing "DaemonSet: Error" indicating shell command failure.

  Troubleshooting Commands

  oc get daemonset node-exporter -n monitoring
  # Output: Error from server (NotFound): daemonsets.apps "node-exporter" not found

  ansible-playbook playbooks/main.yml --tags "node-exporter" -vvv
  # Used verbose mode to see detailed shell command execution

  Root Cause Discovery

  Manual YAML testing revealed the actual issue:
  cat > /tmp/node-exporter-test.yaml << 'EOF'
  # ... DaemonSet YAML content ...
  EOF

  oc apply -f /tmp/node-exporter-test.yaml

  Critical Error Found

  The DaemonSet "node-exporter" is invalid:
  spec.template.spec.containers[0].ports[0].hostPort: Invalid value: 9101:
  must match `containerPort` when `hostNetwork` is true

  Root Cause Explanation

  When hostNetwork: true, Kubernetes requires hostPort to match containerPort. Our configuration had:
  - containerPort: 9100
  - hostPort: 9101
  This mismatch caused the DaemonSet creation to fail.

  Fix Applied

  Updated container configuration:
  ports:
  - containerPort: 9101    # Changed from 9100
    hostPort: 9101
    name: metrics
    protocol: TCP

  Added Node Exporter listen address argument:
  args:
  - '--web.listen-address=:9101'    # Tell Node Exporter to listen on 9101
  - '--path.procfs=/host/proc'
  - '--path.sysfs=/host/sys'
  - '--path.rootfs=/host/root'

  Updated health check probes:
  livenessProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /metrics
      port: 9101    # Changed from 9100
  readinessProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /metrics
      port: 9101    # Changed from 9100

  Updated service:
  ports:
  - port: 9101
    targetPort: 9101    # Changed from 9100
    name: metrics

  Issue 7: Container Crash Due to Incompatible Arguments

  Problem Detection

  oc get pods -n monitoring | grep node-exporter
  # Output: CrashLoopBackOff on all pods

  Troubleshooting Commands

  oc logs node-exporter-bztnj -n monitoring

  Error Found

  node_exporter: error: unknown long flag '--collector.netdev.ignored-devices', try --help

  Root Cause

  Node Exporter v1.6.1 doesn't support some collector flags we included in the configuration.

  Incompatible Flags Identified

  - --collector.netclass.ignored-devices=^(veth.*|[a-f0-9]{15})$
  - --collector.netdev.ignored-devices=^(veth.*|[a-f0-9]{15})$
  - --collector.diskstats.ignored-devices=^(ram|loop|fd|(h|s|v)d[a-z]|nvme\\d+n\\d+p)\\d+$

  Fix Applied

  Removed incompatible flags, keeping only essential ones:
  args:
  - '--web.listen-address=:9101'
  - '--path.procfs=/host/proc'
  - '--path.sysfs=/host/sys'
  - '--path.rootfs=/host/root'
  - '--collector.filesystem.ignored-mount-points=^/(dev|proc|sys|var/lib/docker/.+|var/lib/kubelet/pods/.+)($|/)'
  - '--collector.filesystem.ignored-fs-types=^(autofs|binfmt_misc|cgroup|configfs|debugfs|devpts|devtmpfs|fusectl|hugetlbfs|mqueue|overlay|proc|p
  rocfs|pstore|rpc_pipefs|securityfs|sysfs|tracefs)$'

  Issue 8: Final Security Context Configuration Error

  Problem Detection

  oc describe pod node-exporter-8ftsd -n monitoring

  Error Found

  Warning  Failed: Error: container has runAsNonRoot and image has non-numeric user (nobody),
  cannot verify user is non-root

  Root Cause

  Node Exporter image uses non-numeric user "nobody" but OpenShift security context requires numeric UIDs with runAsNonRoot: true.

  Fix Applied

  Removed the problematic security context setting:
  securityContext: {}    # Changed from runAsNonRoot: true

  ---

  Key Learning Points

  1. OpenShift Security Model: Understanding SCC requirements for privileged workloads
  2. Port Conflicts: Always check for existing services using the same ports
  3. hostNetwork Constraints: When hostNetwork: true, hostPort must match containerPort
  4. Container Image Compatibility: Verify argument compatibility with specific image versions
  5. Security Context: OpenShift requires numeric UIDs or proper SCC bindings
  6. Testing Strategy: Use manual YAML application to isolate Ansible vs Kubernetes issues
  7. Version Compatibility: Always check feature compatibility with deployed image versions

  Prevention Strategies

  1. Pre-deployment Checks: Always check for existing conflicting services
  2. SCC Planning: Identify required privileges early and configure appropriate SCCs
  3. Image Documentation: Verify supported arguments and user configurations
  4. Testing Pipeline: Test YAML configurations manually before Ansible automation
  5. Monitoring: Implement proper health checks and validation steps

  This comprehensive troubleshooting guide provides a complete reference for future Node Exporter deployments and similar privileged workload
  issues in OpenShift/ROSA environments.
