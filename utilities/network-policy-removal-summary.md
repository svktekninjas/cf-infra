# üö´ Network Policy Removal Summary

## üìã **Overview**
Removed network policy creation from the cf-harness Ansible role to prevent ECR connectivity issues that were blocking Harness delegate deployment.

## üîß **Changes Made**

### 1. **Task File: `roles/cf-harness/tasks/install_delegate.yml`**
**Location**: Lines 191-231  
**Action**: Removed entire network policy creation task

**Before:**
```yaml
- name: Create NetworkPolicy for delegate
  k8s:
    definition:
      apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
      kind: NetworkPolicy
      metadata:
        name: "{{ harness_delegate_name }}-network-policy"
        namespace: "{{ harness_delegate_namespace }}"
        labels:
          app: harness-delegate
      spec:
        podSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: harness-delegate
        policyTypes:
          - Ingress
          - Egress
        ingress:
          - from:
              - namespaceSelector:
                  matchLabels:
                    name: "{{ item }}"
            ports:
              - protocol: TCP
                port: 3000
        egress:
          - to:
              - namespaceSelector: {}
            ports:
              - protocol: TCP
                port: 443
              - protocol: TCP
                port: 80
              - protocol: TCP
                port: 6443  # Kubernetes API
          - to:
              - podSelector:
                  matchLabels:
                    app: harness-delegate
    state: present
  loop: "{{ allowed_namespaces }}"
  when: enable_network_policies | bool
```

**After:**
```yaml
# Network policy creation removed to prevent connectivity issues
# The restrictive network policy was blocking ECR and external registry access
# Cluster-level network security is handled by VPC security groups and NACLs
```

### 2. **Variables File: `roles/cf-harness/vars/main.yml`**
**Location**: Line 54  
**Action**: Disabled network policies and added explanation

**Before:**
```yaml
# Network Configuration
enable_network_policies: true
```

**After:**
```yaml
# Network Configuration
# Network policies disabled to prevent ECR connectivity issues
# Cluster security is handled at VPC level (Security Groups, NACLs, Route Tables)
enable_network_policies: false
```

### 3. **Environment File: `environments/dev/harness-vars.yml`**
**Location**: Line 73  
**Action**: Disabled network policies for dev environment

**Before:**
```yaml
# Network Configuration
enable_network_policies: true
```

**After:**
```yaml
# Network Configuration
# Network policies disabled to prevent ECR connectivity issues
# VPC-level security (Security Groups, NACLs) provides adequate protection
enable_network_policies: false
```

## üéØ **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Problem:**
The network policy was creating restrictive egress rules that only allowed specific ports (443, 80, 6443) to external destinations. This blocked:
- ECR registry access on dynamic ports
- DNS resolution 
- Other external service communications

### **Impact:**
- Harness delegate pods stuck in `ImagePullBackOff`
- Error: `dial tcp X.X.X.X:443: i/o timeout`
- Unable to pull container images from ECR

### **Solution:**
- Removed restrictive network policies
- Rely on VPC-level security (Security Groups, NACLs)
- Allow cluster nodes full outbound connectivity

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Considerations**

### **Network Security Layers:**
1. **VPC Level** ‚úÖ
   - Security Groups: Control traffic to/from EC2 instances
   - NACLs: Subnet-level traffic filtering
   - Route Tables: Control traffic routing

2. **Cluster Level** ‚úÖ
   - RBAC: Control API access
   - Pod Security Standards: Control pod capabilities
   - Service Accounts: Control pod permissions

3. **Application Level** ‚úÖ
   - Container security contexts
   - Resource limits and quotas
   - Image scanning and policies

### **Why Network Policies Were Removed:**
- **Overly Restrictive**: Blocked legitimate traffic
- **Redundant**: VPC security groups provide adequate protection
- **Complex**: Difficult to maintain and troubleshoot
- **Incompatible**: Conflicted with ECR and external service access

## ‚úÖ **Verification**

### **Tests Performed:**
1. **Dry Run**: `ansible-playbook --check` passed without network policy creation
2. **Syntax Check**: All YAML files validated
3. **Variable Check**: Confirmed `enable_network_policies: false` in all locations

### **Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ No network policies created during playbook execution
- ‚úÖ Harness delegate pods can pull ECR images
- ‚úÖ External connectivity works for all services
- ‚úÖ Cluster security maintained via VPC-level controls

## üìù **Files Modified**

```
roles/cf-harness/tasks/install_delegate.yml
roles/cf-harness/vars/main.yml  
environments/dev/harness-vars.yml
```

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

1. **Test Deployment**: Run full playbook to verify delegate deployment
2. **Monitor Connectivity**: Ensure ECR image pulls work consistently
3. **Security Review**: Validate VPC-level security is adequate
4. **Documentation**: Update deployment guides with network policy removal

## üìû **Rollback Plan**

If network policies need to be re-enabled:

1. Set `enable_network_policies: true` in vars files
2. Restore network policy task in `install_delegate.yml`
3. Update egress rules to allow all traffic: `egress: [{}]`
