## Version Compatibility Matrix

| Tool | Old Version | New Version | Notes |
|------|------------|-------------|-------|
| ansible | 2.15.0 (invalid) | 11.5.0 | Includes ansible-core 2.18.x |
| ansible-lint | 6.22.0 | 24.10.0 | Latest stable |
| yamllint | 1.33.0 | 1.35.1 | Latest stable |
| molecule | 6.0.2 | 24.10.0 | Latest stable |
| trivy-action | v0.17.0 | v0.28.0 | Latest stable |

## GitHub Actions Used

All actions are using the latest stable versions:
- `actions/checkout@v4`
- `actions/setup-python@v5`
- `actions/cache@v4`
- `actions/upload-artifact@v4`
- `actions/download-artifact@v4`
- `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3`
- `actions/github-script@v7`

## Testing the Workflow

The workflow will now:
1. Install the correct Ansible version (11.5.0)
2. Run YAML linting with updated yamllint
3. Run ansible-lint with production profile
4. Perform security scanning with latest Trivy
5. Validate variables and documentation

## Next Steps

After pushing these changes:
1. The GitHub Actions workflow should pass
2. Monitor the first run for any remaining issues
3. All CI/CD checks should complete successfully
